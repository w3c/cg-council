<!doctype html><html lang=en><title>Community and Business Group Process</title><body><p class="intro dark-blue">This document governs participation in W3C Community and Business Groups. For information about other types of groups in W3C, please see the  <a href="/Consortium/Process/">W3C Process Document</a>.</p>

<h2 class="handwriting">Summary</h2>

<p>Since the early days of the Consortium, the number of stakeholders of the Web has grown significantly, powerful collaboration tools have gone mainstream, and expectations about standards themselves have evolved. W3C&#8217;s &#8220;classic&#8221; process and Membership models meet the needs of some stakeholders, but not all. W3C seeks to offer larger numbers of developers, designers, and others passionate about the Web the means to build communities.</p>
<p>This document defines <a href="#community-process">W3C Community Groups</a>, where anyone may develop Specifications, hold discussions, develop tests, and so on, with no participation fee. Community groups emphasize individual innovation and allow an easy way for innovation from individuals to move to the &#8220;classic&#8221; W3C standards process, which emphasizes broad consensus-building and implementation among global stakeholders. Community Groups that develop specifications do so under policies designed to strike a balance between ease of participation and safety for implementers and patent holders. The new offering complements the classic process and patent policy; it does not replace it.</p>
<p>This document also defines <a href="#business-process">Business Groups</a> to increase participation by organizations that may not be primarily motivated by participation in W3C standards development but instead are interested in the application of W3C technologies to business problems, and in providing high-bandwidth input to the standards process. Business Group participants who are not W3C Members pay for staff resources, but the <a href="fees">fee</a> for participating in Business Groups is less than W3C Membership (and grants fewer benefits).</p>
<p>These programs are managed by a Community Development Lead, chosen by W3C management. The roles of the Community Development Lead are described throughout this document.</p>

			<h3 class="handwriting red">Creation of a Community Group</h3>
			<p id="complete-proposal">Anyone may propose the creation of a Community Group. A proposal is &#8220;complete&#8221; when:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It includes a name for the group (not already taken by a Community Group) and a scope description. The scope <span class="rfc2119">should</span> be different than that of any other Community Group (but it may be the same, such as when two communities wish to explore two solutions to the same set of problems). </li>
				<li>Five individuals support the creation of the group. The W3C Forum may be used to build this support.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once a proposal is complete, W3C announces the creation of the group (which includes its software infrastructure). This date is called the <span id="launchdate">&#8220;launch date.&#8221;</span></p>
			<p>The Community Development Lead does not formally approve proposals but <span class="rfc2119">may</span> reject a proposal for a Community Group when the scope is likely to cause offense or confusion, is frivolous, or is overly broad.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h4 class="handwriting red">Community Group Operational Agreements</h4>
			<p>A Community Group <span class="rfc2119">may</span> adopt operational agreements (recorded, for example, in the form of a charter) that establish the group's scope of work, decision-making processes, communications preferences, and other operations.  For example, the agreement could establish fair and reasonable criteria for accepting contributions in a specification, or set the group's scope of work (e.g., development of educational materials or discussions about future standards work at W3C).</p>
			<p>The following rules govern Community Group operational agreements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>They <span class="rfc2119">must</span>  be publicly documented.</li>
				<li>They <span class="rfc2119">must</span> be fair  and <span class="rfc2119">must not</span> unreasonably favor or discriminate against any group participant or their employer.</li>
				<li>They <span class="rfc2119">must not</span> conflict with or modify this Community and Business Group Process, the <a href="cla">Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>, or the <a href="final">Final Specification Agreement</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The person who first proposes a group <span class="rfc2119">may</span> establish the group's initial operational agreements. Thereafter, the Chair determines the means by which the group adopts and modifies operational agreements. The Chair must give actual notice to the participants of any material changes to the agreements. Participants may resign from the group if they do not wish to participate under the new agreements.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> W3C encourages groups adopt decision-making policies that promote consensus.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3 class="handwriting red">Joining a Community Group</h3>
			<p>Anyone may join any Community Group. There are no participation fees.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h3 class="handwriting red">Resigning from a Community Group</h3>
			<p>W3C will provide a mechanism for Participants to resign from a Community Group. Participants that resign from a Community Group incur no new or further obligations after the date of resignation and maintain only those obligations already incurred, and that survive resignation from the Community Group, as provided in the <a href="cla">Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a> and, when applicable, the <a href="final">Final Specification Agreement</a>.</p>
		</section>
	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red">Community Group Chair(s)</h3>
	<p>Each Community Group <span class="rfc2119">must</span> have at least one Chair who is responsible for ensuring the group fulfills the requirements of this document as well as the group's operational agreements. The participants of the Group choose their Chair(s). The Chair(s) are also the primary contacts for the Community Development Lead.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red">Duration and Closure of a Community Group</h3>
	<p>Once a Community Group has been launched, participants may continue to work indefinitely, until the Community Development Lead closes the group; see the <a href="#grounds">grounds for closure</a>. </p>
	<p>No less than ten business days before closing a group, the Community Development Lead <span class="rfc2119">must</span> alert the participants. Once closed, no individuals may join, and discussions stop. However, W3C makes available information about closed Community Groups and archives of their communications.</p>
	<p>Closed Community Groups are re-opened following the <a href="#creation">creation process</a>.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red">Grounds for Closure of a Community Group</h3>
	<p>The Community Development Lead may close a Community Group in any of following circumstances:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Chair Request</strong>. The Group Chair requests that the group be closed (e.g., as the result of a group decision, or on a certain date selected in advance by the group).</li>
	<li><strong>Inactivity</strong>. The number of participants drops below 3 for an extended period, or because participant activity (e.g., as measured by communications among participants) ceases for an extended period.</li>
	<li><strong>Agreement Violations</strong>. When, in the judgment of the Community Development Lead, the group has committed a serious violation of this policy, for instance exceeding its scope.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Community Development Lead and Chair <span class="rfc2119">should</span> discuss the group&#8217;s status before the Community Development Lead initiates closure.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red">Community Group Communications</h3>
	<p>Each Community Group will have both public and non-public communications mechanisms. The former are for work, the latter for administrative matters (e.g., personal information used in meeting planning). </p>
	<p>To help Community Group participants adhere to the <a href="#general-policies">general communications policies</a>, all participants (including the Chair) <span class="rfc2119">should</span> help moderate discussion (for instance, to keep the group focused on relevant topics).</p>
	<p>In order to help the community track process, each Community Group is encouraged to summarize accomplishments, barriers to progress, or other challenges from time to time.</p>
	<p>All communications <span class="rfc2119">must</span> be archived.</p>
	</section><section>
	<h4 class="handwriting red">Community Group Branding</h4>
	<p>Any Community Group branding (e.g., use of W3C name or logo in ways that may confuse the state of standardization, or technology-specific logo development)  is subject to review and approval by the Head of W3C Marketing and Communications.</p>
	</section>

	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red">Community Group Meeting Policies</h3>
	<p>A Community Group is not required to hold meetings. However, if it does, then the Chair <span class="rfc2119">must</span> ensure that the following happens:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>the meeting is announced to the group in a timely fashion so that people can schedule attendance;</li>
	<li>an agenda is posted;</li>
	<li>meeting minutes are published, including topics discussions and decisions.</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red">Community Group Deliverables</h3>
	<p>Community Group deliverables may be anything, including documents, test suites, tutorials, demos, code, discussion, etc. W3C will provide infrastructure to host discussions, code, specifications, test suites, and so on.</p>

	<p>The label "Community Group Report" refers to any document produced by a Group. Some Community Group Reports are Specifications. The following rules apply to Specifications:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>drafts are governed by <a href="cla">Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. W3C will provide a template for including copyright information.</li>
	<li>they <span class="rfc2119">must</span> include the name the group that published the deliverables and link to a public page about the group.</li>
	<li>they <span class="rfc2119">must</span> include a publication date.</li>
	<li>the history of Contributions (as defined under the CLA) <span class="rfc2119">must</span>  be archived permanently on the W3C Web site.</li>
	<li>They <span class="rfc2119">must</span> include boilerplate language required by W3C (e.g., notice that Contributions are made under the CLA and that certain conditions apply).</li>
	<li>When published on the W3C site, they <span class="rfc2119">must not</span> violate the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/privacy-statement-20000612">W3C Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
	<li>The content and style of the Specification <span class="rfc2119">must not</span> cause confusion about its status, in particular with respect to <a href="/TR/">W3C Technical Reports</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The following rules apply to Final Specifications:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>when they are published, W3C issues a call for participants to sign the <a href="final">Final Specification Agreement</a>.</li>
	<li>they <span class="rfc2119">must</span> be available in English.</li>
	<li>they <span class="rfc2119">must</span> be published on the W3C Web site.</li>
	<li> Once a Final Specification has been published at a given URI, the Specification <span class="rfc2119">must not</span> change.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Other types of deliverables <span class="rfc2119">must</span> be publicly available and must be archived permanently.</p>

	<p>W3C reserves the right to refuse publication of deliverables, for instance if the material is likely to cause offense or confusion. W3C <span class="rfc2119">may</span> publish additional policies to govern Community Group Specifications. W3C will provide style guides (and style sheets) for Specifications.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red" id="community-council">Community Council</h3>
	<p>The Community Development Lead organizes a Community Council whose mission is:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>to promote the program and ensure that it functions smoothly, and</li>
	<li>to help the Community Development Lead fulfill the duties described in this document.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Initially the Community Development Lead selects the Council participants, with an emphasis on representation of diverse interests (public, W3C Membership, staff, other standards organizations, etc.). The Community Development Lead may develop other mechanisms for participant selection.</p>
	</section><section>
	<h4 id="council-inreach">Inreach</h4>
	<p>The Community Council works with existing groups in a variety of ways, including:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Education of Community Group participants about doing work at W3C. This might involve creation of documentation, videos, or other tools. It might also involve chair training or providing good practice information to Chairs.</li>
	<li>Education of the broader community about the work done by Community Groups. </li>
	<li>Connections among groups that have shared interests. This might involve organizing joint meetings.</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h4 id="council-outreach">Outreach</h4>
	<p>The Council promotes broad inclusion and participation by newcomers in a variety of ways, including:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Promotion of the program in online fora, at events, and in new communities.</li>
	<li>Encouraging the creation of language-specific groups, international participation, and online meetings.</li>
	<li>Efforts that help avoid confusion with W3C&#8217;s standardization process (e.g., through videos or other materials that help explain how to do work at W3C).
		  </li>
	</ul>
	</section>

	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red" id="transition">Transition to W3C Standards Track</h3>
	<p>Some (but not all) Community Group and Business Group Specifications are expected to serve as input to a Working Group. W3C facilitates the transition from Community Group to the W3C Standards Track in a number of ways:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><strong>Continuity of IPR commitments</strong>. The <a href="final">W3C Community Final Specification Agreement</a> is designed to ensure smooth transition of IPR commitments from Community Groups or Business Groups to Working Groups.</li>
	<li id="participanttrans"><strong>Continuity of participation</strong>. When a Working Group takes up a Community Group or Business Group Specification, non-Member employees may continue their participation in the Working Group for a limited duration while their employer makes the transition to Membership. The individual&#8217;s employer must have fulfilled the organizational patent requirements of the <a href="final">W3C Community Final Specification Agreement</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Simplified charter template</strong>. If the mission of a new Working Group is simply to advance a Community Group or Business Group Specification to Recommendation, W3C will provide a simplified charter template. Working Group charters created to standardize a Community Group or Business Group Specifications are be reviewed by the Membership following the usual process. </li>
	</ul>
	</section><section>
	<h4>Parallel Activities between a Community Group and a Working Group</h4>
	<p>A Community Group may continue to exist after a Working Group has been chartered. The Community Group may wish to start experimenting with new ideas for a technology while the Working Group builds consensus and focuses on implementation of a stable set of agreed upon features.</p>
	<p>W3C recommends that once a Working Group has taken up a Community Group or Business Group Specification, the Community or Business Group should no longer develop the same material in parallel. Working Group licensing commitments are limited to the deliverables of the Working Group, so commitments do not follow text that is taken up by other groups (Community Groups or Working Groups).</p>

	<p id="business-process">Business Groups are open to all (including companies, non-profits, government agencies, research institutes, individuals), but parties that are not W3C Members pay a <a href="/community/about/agreements/fees/">fee</a> to participate. That fee is less than W3C Membership and grants fewer benefits. Business Groups are designed to provide stakeholders in particular industries with a forum to develop industry-specific applications of Web technology, to create a strong liaison between a particular industry and the Web community, or to solve an industry-specific issue without an initial assumption of which Web technologies apply.</p>
	<p>Business Group policies are the same as Community Groups except where noted below.</p>
	</section><section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red" id="bg-creation">Creation of a Business Group</h3>
	<p>Business Groups are created in the same manner as Community Groups, except that a proposal is not <a href="#complete-proposal">complete</a> until at least five <em>Organizations</em> support creation of the group. Because goal of Business Groups is to grow the W3C community, we expect Business Groups to have a mix of Member and non-Member Organizations and individuals.</p>

	<h3 class="handwriting red" id="bg-join">Joining a Business Group</h3>
	<p>Joining a Business Group is the same as for a Community Group, except that:</p>

	<li>there is a participation <a href="/community/about/agreements/fees/">fee</a> (for organizations and individuals), and</li>
	<li>participants <span class="rfc2119">must</span> also agree to the Business Group Agreement.</li>
	</ul>

	<section>
	<h3 class="handwriting red" id="bg-communications">Business Group Communications</h3>
	<p>Each Business Group will have both public and non-public communications mechanisms. The participants decide which channel they use to conduct their work. If the group chooses to conduct its work on non-public channels, the group <span class="rfc2119">must</span> maintain a public home page on the W3C site and <span class="rfc2119">must</span> provide a public communication about their work at least every six months. This may take the form of a publication, a summary of work, or other form most suitable to keep the community informed of its progress.</p>

	<h3 class="handwriting red" id="bg-staff">Staff Involvement in Business Groups</h3>
	<p>Business Groups do not have staff contacts, but W3C management allocates a small percentage of staff time to consult to Business Groups and help them accomplish their goals.</p>
	<p>In addition:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Business Group Chairs may request an annual review with W3C management and the technical staff, to share progress and gather feedback on technical direction.</li>
	<li>For Business Groups creating materials they intend as input to a Working Group (e.g., an industry-specific set of requirements), the staff will help to coordinate direct Chair-to-Chair communication.</li>

	<h3 class="handwriting red" id="ipr">Summary of Copyright and Patent Policies for Community Groups</h3>
	<p>The legal policies designed for Community Groups seek to balance the concerns of both implementers and intellectual property (IPR) holders. This section gives an informative overview of the two license agreements involved:</p>
	<ul>
	<li><a href="cla">W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a></li>
	<li><a href="final">W3C Community Final Specification Agreement</a></li>
	</ul>
	</section><section>
	<h4>Copyright</h4>
	<p>All participant contributions to a Specification produced by the group are made available under a permissive copyright license that allows the creation of derivative works subject to attribution requirements.</p>
	<p>A Business Group <span class="rfc2119">may</span> choose to publish its document under the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231">W3C Document Licence</a>.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h4>Patents</h4>
	<p>The patent policy has two steps:</p>
	<ol>
	<li><strong>Contributor Agreement</strong>. A participant that makes a contribution to a specification produced by the group agrees to Royalty-Free patent licenses for the contribution. This commitment is governed by the <a href="cla">W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</a>. <strong>Note</strong>: The CLA provides patent rights only to individual Contributions.  W3C will provide mechanisms for participants to indicate clearly their Contributions.</li> 
	<li><strong>Final Specification Agreement</strong>. When the group has completed work on the specification and wishes to promote broader deployment, the  Chair issues a <strong>call for final commitments</strong>. Participants make <em>voluntary</em> Royalty-Free patent license commitments over the <em>entire</em> specification by
	executing the <a href="final">W3C Community Final Specification Agreement</a>. In addition, the Community Final Specification Agreement involves a commitment so that material that advances to W3C Recommendation also benefits (automatically) from a Royalty-Free commitment.  </li>
	</ol>
	<p>The two-step process is designed to:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>make it possible to start a group quickly, since organizations may not be required to evaluate portfolios against a scope statement.</li>
	<li>make it easier for organizations to join a group, since an organization's initial commitment only extends to the organization's own contributions.</li>
	<li>provide implementers with some patent protection during development of a specification, and patent protection for the final specification from those signing the Final Specification Agreement.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>W3C has a preference for organizational, rather than individual commitments. Requests to participate in an individual capacity without a corresponding organizational commitment will be subject to approval by the W3C staff; such approval to be granted or denied in the W3C Staff’s sole discretion.</p>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h4>Disclosure</h4>
	<p>The policies do not define any patent disclosure obligations.</p>
	</section>

	<h3 class="handwriting red" id="general-policies">General Communications Policies</h3>
	<p>All Participants agree to the following general communications policies:</p>
