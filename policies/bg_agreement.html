<p>
c. The Participant hereby agrees to pay the applicable Fee. The initial Fee of <{$fee}> is due upon signature of this Agreement.

The Business Group Participant Fee is due annually thereafter on the Anniversary Date for as long as the Business Group continues.  Except as provided for in this Agreement, the Fee is non-refundable and shall be payable to the Participant's Host, in the currency stated.
</p>

<p>d. The Participant's initial Fee shall be discounted by 50% for the initial year if Participant joins an in-progress Business Group six months or more after the Anniversary Date.
</p>

<p>e. If Participant has subsidiaries, the rights and privileges granted under this Agreement shall extend to all subsidiaries the voting stock of which is directly or indirectly at least fifty percent (50%) owned or controlled by Participant.</p>

<p>f. For a Participant that is itself a consortium, user society, or otherwise has members or sponsors, the rights and privileges granted under this Agreement shall extend to any number of paid employees of the Participant who are appointed by Participant and to one other individual not employed by the Participant.

</p>

<p>b. The Participant may terminate this Agrement by written notice to the Participant's Host no later than sixty (60) days prior to the Anniversary Date. If the Consortium receives termination notices such that the number of Organizations in the group drops below the threshold required by the Hosts for a Business Group, the Consortium may terminate the group and this Agreement by written notice to the Participant, effective as of the next Anniversary Date.</p>


<h2 id="ipr">3. Intellectual Property Rights.</h2>

<p>Per the Process, participants may choose to license Business Group outputs under the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2002/copyright-documents-20021231">W3C Document License</a>.

<h2 id="relationship-of-parties">6. Relationship of Parties.</h2>

<p>The relationship of the parties under this Agreement shall be that of a voluntary association. The Consortium is not a separate legal entity, and this Agreement does not create a partnership or joint venture. Neither MIT, ERCIM, KEIO, BEIHANG, nor the Participant can bind the other or create any relationship of principal or agent.</p>

This remedy is in lieu of all other remedies, whether oral or written, express or implied. MIT's liability to the Participant in the event of any other claim by Participant shall be limited to the amount of the Participant's duly paid Fee. In no event shall MIT, ERCIM, KEIO, and/or BEIHANG be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages, including lost profits, sustained or incurred by the Participant in connection with or as a result of its participation in the Business Group or under this Agreement.</p>

<h2 id="force-majeure">8. Force Majeure.</h2>

<p>If the performance of any obligation by MIT, ERCIM, KEIO and BEIHANG under this Agreement is prevented, restricted or interfered with by reason of natural disaster, war, revolution, civil commotion, acts of public enemies, blockade, embargo, strikes, any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand or requirement having a legal effect of any government or any judicial authority or representative of any such government, or any other act or event which is beyond the reasonable control of the party affected, then MIT, ERCIM, KEIO and BEIHANG shall be excused from such performance to the extent of such prevention, restriction, or interference, provided that MIT, ERCIM, KEIO, and BEIHANG shall use reasonable commercial efforts to avoid or remove such causes of nonperformance, and shall continue performance hereunder with reasonable dispatch whenever such causes are removed.</p>

<h2 id="export-controls">9. Export Controls.</h2>

<p>The Participant acknowledges that export and/or re-export from the United States, France, or Japan of technical data, computer software, laboratory prototypes and other commodities ("Controlled Commodities") may be subject to the export control laws and regulation of the United States (including the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, and the Export Administration Act of 1979 revised in 1985), of France, and of Japan, and that such laws and regulations could preclude or delay export of such Controlled Commodities.  MIT 's, ERCIM's, KEIO's, and BEIHANG'S obligation hereunder are contingent on compliance with such applicable laws and regulations. Neither party will directly or indirectly export across any national boundary, or communicate or transfer to any third party, any Controlled Commodities without first obtaining any and all licenses that may be required from a cognizant agency of the United States government or the French or Japanese authorities, and/or any and all written assurances from the Participant that it will not re-export or transfer such Controlled Commodities to certain foreign countries or third parties without prior approval of the cognizant government agency. While MIT, ERCIM, KEIO, and BEIHANG agree to cooperate in securing any license which the cognizant agency deems necessary in connection with the export, re-export, transfer or communication of any Controlled Commodities, MIT, ERCIM, KEIO, and BEIHANG cannot guarantee that such licenses will be granted.</p>

<p>Neither this Agreement nor any rights hereunder, in whole or in part, are assignable by the Participant without the prior written consent of the Hosts. Any attempt to assign the rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement by the Participant without such consent shall be a breach of this Agreement and shall be null and void.</p>

<h2 id="entire-agreement">11. Entire Agreement.</h2>
