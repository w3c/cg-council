A "Large" organization is one whose annual gross revenue, as measured by the most recent audited statement, is greater than or equal to 50M USD. A "Small" organization is one with revenues less than that threshold, with more than one employee.

For non-Member Organizations that join a Business Group, any number of their employees may participate in that group.

If an Organization is itself a consortium, user society, or otherwise has members or sponsors, the Organization may assign any number of paid staff to a Business Group <strong>and</strong> one other individual not employed by the Organization (or more at the discretion of the Community Development Lead).

An unaffiliated individual is one that has no significant employment relationship with an Organization. An unaffiliated individual is not considered an "Organization" under this policy.

W3C Members <span class="rfc2119">must not</span> assign non-employee representatives to a Business Group.

After joining a group, non-Member participants sign the <a href="/community/about/fees/bg-participation-agreement/">Business Group Participation Agreement</a>, which addresses payments, renewal, termination, and other administrative matters.</body>
