# Community Group Process

**Status**: This is a draft for discussion. 

This version of the process does not mention Business Groups, but that is mostly to focus discussion on Community Groups. This is not meant to imply anything about the future of Business Groups.

## Abstract

This document governs participation in W3C Community Groups. For information about other types of groups in W3C, please see the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/).

## Summary

Since 2011, the W3C Community Group program has hosted discussions about the Web and supported incubation of new technologies. Community Group Specifications are not W3C standards or part of W3C's standardization agenda, but Community Group Specifications that gain traction often do advance to [standardization at W3C](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/) or in other standards bodies. This document defines the processes that govern the creation and operation of Community Groups. In addition to this document, the following policies govern other aspects of participation in Community Groups:

* [W3C Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/)
* [W3C Antitrust and competition policy](https://www.w3.org/policies/antitrust-2024/)
* [Community Group patent and copyright policies](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/summary/)
* [Guidelines to suspend or remove participants from groups](https://www.w3.org/guide/process/suspension.html), which this policy extends to Community Groups.

W3C may, from time to time, create additional [policies](https://www.w3.org/policies/) that govern aspects of participation in Community Groups.

## Community Group program management

The Community Groups Program is managed by the W3C Community Development Lead, chosen by W3C management. The roles of the Community Development Lead are described throughout this document.

For any questions about the Community Groups program, including discussions about the transition from a Community Group to a standardization group, please contact the Community Development Lead at team-community-process@w3.org.

## Participation in Community Groups

Community Groups are open to all with no fee.

### Intellectual Property Policies

The Community Group intellectual property (IPR) policies seek to balance the concerns of both implementers and participants who hold Intellectual Property. Please see the [Patent and Copyright Policy Summary](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/summary/), which covers the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/2025/08/cla) and the [W3C Community Final Specification Agreement (FSA)](https://www.w3.org/2025/08/final). 

W3C has a preference for organizational, rather than individual patent commitments. Requests to participate in an individual capacity without a corresponding organizational commitment will be subject to approval by the W3C staff; such approval to be granted or denied in the W3C Staffâ€™s sole discretion. See the [Guidelines for Evaluating Individual Requests to Participate in a Group](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/guidelines-for-evaluating-individual-requests-to-participate-in-a-group/).

When a participant resigns from a Community Group, they incur no new or further obligations after the date of resignation and maintain only those obligations already incurred, and that survive resignation from the Community Group, as provided in the CLA and, when applicable, the FSA.

### When participation issues arise

This process adopts the [Guidelines to suspend or remove participants from groups](https://www.w3.org/guide/process/suspension.html) for handling participation issues in Community Groups.

## Lifecycle of Community Groups

The following sections describe the lifecycle of a Community Group: **proposed**, **active**, **dormant**, **archived**.

### Proposed

Anyone may propose a Community Group. A Community Group proposal must include:

* A group name (not already taken by a Community Group)
* A description

If the group expects to publish Specifications, the description must make this clear. In addition, it is good practice to include in the description:

* A statement defining the scope of any anticipated Specification. The scope of a Specification should be different than that of any other Community Group (but it may be the same, such as when two communities wish to explore two solutions to the same set of problems).
* Any initial expectations about standardization plans.

If scope and standardization plans are not known at the time of the proposal, they should be updated once the group has been created and that information becomes known.

#### Grounds for rejection of a proposal

The Community Development Lead does not formally approve proposals but may reject a proposal for a Community Group when the name or description are likely to cause offense or confusion, appear primarily intended for commercial purposes, are frivolous, or are overly broad.

### Active

Once five individuals support a proposal and it has been reviewed by the Community Development Lead, the Community Development Lead launches the group.

#### Chair(s)

Each Community Group must have at least one Chair who is responsible for:

* facilitating effective discussion and coordinating the group's activities;
* ensuring that group decisions reflect those discussion discussion;
* ensuring the group fulfills the requirements of Community Group policies and publication requirements, as well as the group's charter (if it has one).

The participants of the Group choose their Chair(s). The Chair(s) are also the primary contacts for the Community Development Lead. The Community Development Lead may be consulted in cases where participants face challenges in Chair selection.

The Community Development Lead may remove a Community Group Chair after reasonable attempts to understand any complaints and resolve issues. A Chair that has been removed by the Community Development Lead may not become Chair again in the same group without approval from the Community Development Lead.

#### Charter

A Community Group should (but is not required to) have a charter that describes the group's scope of work, deliverables, contribution policies, decision process, chair selection process, and charter amendment process. W3C provides a [Community Group charter template](https://w3c.github.io/cg-charter/CGCharter.html). How a group adopts its charter is decided by the group.

If a Community Group charter exists, it must be publicly available and must not conflict with or modify this process, the [W3C Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/), the [W3C Antitrust and competition policy](https://www.w3.org/policies/antitrust-2024/), the Community Group patent and copyright policies, or any other policies for Community Groups.

The Chair must give actual notice to the participants of any material changes to a charter. Participants may resign from the group if they do not wish to participate under a new charter.

#### Decisions and appeals

Consensus is a core value of W3C and decisions by consensus play an important role in the [W3C standardization process](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#consensus-building). In the Community Group program, consensus decisions are appreciated but not required, and participants should bear in mind that the goal of incubation is idea generation.

The Community Group program is meant to be lightweight enough so that participants with divergent views can pursue them in a different Community Group. In some cases, however, such as when a Community Group Specification has gained significant traction, it may no longer be a viable option to develop a competing proposal. In this case, the standardization process (which offers stronger guarantees and governance mechanisms) may well be the proper venue for resolving issues.

A participant who wishes to contest a process matter should first discuss it with the Chair(s). If doing so fails to resolve the issue, the participant may escalate to the Community Development Lead, who will work with the participant and Chairs to understand the situation and pursue a fair resolution.

#### Meetings

A Community Group is not required to hold meetings. However, if it does, then the Chair should ensure that:

* the meeting is announced to the group in a timely fashion so that people can schedule attendance;
* an agenda is posted;
* meeting minutes are published, including topic discussions and decisions.

#### Communications

Although W3C provides some facilities to support group discussions (e.g., mailing lists), a Community Group chooses its preferred mechanisms. Technical work must be conducted in public and past discussions should remain available online (e.g., in email archives). Private channels may be used for administrative matters (e.g., where personal information is used for meeting planning).

Participants must not send unsolicited commercial messages or other promotional activities for personal matters or for third parties. See the [W3C Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/) and the [W3C Antitrust and competition policy](https://www.w3.org/policies/antitrust-2024/) for more policies related to communications.

Community Groups must not refer to Community Group specifications as W3C standards, or otherwise create confusion about the status of work. Community Groups must not use the W3C logo in communications without the express permission of W3C.

### Dormant

From time to time a Community Group may wish to communicate that its work has slowed (but not stopped) and set some expectations about when the group expects to become active again.

All Chairs of a Community Group must agree that the group should enter the dormant state, and contact the Community Development Lead to move the group to that state.

While a group is dormant:

* People may still join or leave the group, and the chairs may change.
* W3C will not generally invite the group to W3C events where other groups are meeting.
* W3C staff will continue to monitor group activity but only expects to reach out to the group if regular activity is detected.

To return to an active state the group must have at least one Chair, all Chairs must agree that the group should be reactivated, and they should contact the Community Development Lead, who decides whether to reactivate the group.

### Archived

Once a group has completed its work, the Chairs should request that a group be archived.

No less than 10 business days before archiving a group, the Community Development Lead must alert the participants. Once archived, no individuals may join, and discussions stop. However, W3C continues to make available information about archived Community Groups and their previous communications it hosted (if any).

An archived group may be re-activated with the approval of the Community Development Lead.

#### Grounds for staff to archive a group

The Community Development Lead may archive a group for other reasons than a Chair request:

* **No Chair**. When the Community Development Lead detects that a group has lacked a chair for 30 business days or more, they alert the participants that the group will be archived if no chair has been named within 30 business days. 
* **Inactivity**. The number of participants drops below 3 for an extended period, or because participant activity (e.g., as measured by communications among participants) ceases for an extended period. Dormant groups will, in general, not be archived due to inactivity.
* **Time for a new home**. When a Community Group Specification has traction but the group expressly does not wish to advance it to standardization, the Community Development Lead will assist the group in finding a new home outside of W3C for the community, then archive the group and redirect people to the new home. 
* **Agreement violations**. When, in the judgment of the Community Development Lead, the group has committed a serious violation of policies governing Community Groups.
* **Confusing communications**. If the Community Development Lead determines that a group or its participants show a pattern of creating confusion about their work or its status (including Specifications that do not conform to requirements for Community Group Specifications), the Community Development Lead may take steps to remedy the situation, including archiving the group.

## Community Group Deliverables

Some Community Groups create deliverables, while others simply hold discussions. This process primarily includes requirements on one type of Community Group deliverable: **Community Group Specifications**.

Non-Specification Community Group deliverables must be publicly available at no cost. This process does not include IPR or other requirements for non-Specification deliverables (e.g., code, test suites, or other documents that are not Specifications).

### Community Group Specifications

A Community Group Specification is any document intended to enable interoperable implementation of a technology. In case there is any doubt about whether a Community Group deliverable is a Specification, the Community Development Lead makes a determination for the purposes of conformance to Community Group policies.

#### Intellectual Property

Contributions and licensing commitments are governed by [Community Group patent and copyright policies](https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/summary/). 

#### Lifecycle of Community Group Specifications

When a Community Group incubates a specification, they should have an eye towards future standardization. The CG program is meant to support technology development up to a point (and for an extended period of time), but not to be a permanent home.

The maturity stages in the lifecycle of a Community Group Specification are:

* **Draft**: The Specification is in development in a Community Group.
* **Snapshot**: This particular version of the Specification will not change. The label "snapshot" on its own does not indicate whether this is a stable version of the Specification that is actively in use and may still be in development, or a snapshot of the Specification that has been abandoned and is not in use. Critical details about the status of the work are found in the Specification.
* **Transferred**: This Specification is no longer in development in this Community Group. It has been transferred to a standardization activity and that activity should be consulted for the latest status.

#### Publication

Community Group Specifications must not claim to be W3C standards or otherwise cause confusion about their status, in particular with respect to W3C Technical Reports.

The Community Development Lead will separately document the [requirements that govern publication of Community Group Specifications](https://www.w3.org/community/reports/reqs/), including maturity stage information, boilerplate language, and style requirements. 

In cases where Specifications do not meet these requirements, after attempts to remedy the situation, the Community Development Lead may take steps such as making changes directly to the Specification, removing a Specification from the W3C Web site, or in rare cases, archiving a group.

#### Transition to Standardization

Some (but not all) Community Group Specifications advance to standardization in W3C or another standards body.

A Community Group that is interested in standardization (at W3C or elsewhere) should contact the Community Development Lead who will organize a conversation about [Considerations when transferring a CG Specification for Standardization](https://github.com/w3c/cg-council/blob/main/transfer-considerations.md).

A Community Group should document its standardization plans for a Specification as soon as they are made. W3C will provide guidance to help Community Groups communicate their standardization plans.

After a Community Group has transferred a Specification for standardization, the receiving standards group takes over responsibility for that snapshot. When the Community Group and standards group seek further collaboration, the Community Group may continue to incubate new features of the technology.

When a Community Group Specification has traction and the Community Group does not wish to pursue standardization, the staff will help support the group's migration to another venue.
