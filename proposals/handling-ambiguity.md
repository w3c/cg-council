# Handling standardization ambiguity

The [About page for CGs](https://www.w3.org/community/about/) begins:

> W3C has created Community and Business Groups to meet the needs of a growing community of Web stakeholders. Community Groups enable anyone to socialize their ideas for the Web at the W3C for possible future standardization.

The program thus sets an expectation that when a CG incubates a specification, they should have an eye towards future standardization. The CG program is meant to support technology development up to a point (and for an extended period of time), but not to be a permanent home.

Community Groups frequently find themselves in one of three situations:

* A specification has traction and advances to either a W3C Working Group or another SDO.
* A specification does not gain traction and is retired without standardization.
* A specification has gained some traction, but the group has no clear standardization expectation or plan.

In the first two cases the work on the Community Group specification can be stopped, either because the group has succeeded in transitioning to standardization, or it is clear that they are ready to stop the effort.

In this document we discuss ideas to support groups in the third situation, called here "standardization ambiguity."

## Why this matters

Once a CG specification has gained some traction, it is common for the community to require some time to complete its work and line up support before transitioning the work to a standardization group. In some cases, however, a specification may have traction for years but does not advance to standardization. Reasons include:

* There is vibrant ecosystem for this technology (so work on it shouldn't be stopped), but may not fulfil all standardization readiness expectations (e.g., only one implementation with no clear commitment from other implementers and the group is waiting for a second implementation).
* There are a large number of implementations of this specification, and for that reason, the community does not see the value in making the effort to go through standardization.
* The group may wish to advance to standardization, but has questions (where? how?) or is concerned about obstacles.

When CG specifications with traction do not advance for an extended period of time, this creates problems for the broader community as well as W3C specifically. For instance, CG specifications for the Web that gain traction but that do not undergo the quality controls of the W3C Process may harm the Web ecosystem by facilitating the emergence (and possibly wide adoption) of worse solutions than what a standardization process would produce. CG specifications with traction may also create confusion in the market about whether they are standards. That confusion can harm W3C's reputation, and could lead to other risks as well.

## Proposed approach

Once the staff is aware that a specification has traction (e.g., through communication with the chairs or via tooling that is being developed), the staff organizes a chat with the CG chairs.

In the case of standardization ambiguity, the staff will focus on the question: **does the group want to advance to standardization**?

If the answer is "yes" or "maybe," then the staff will work with the group to understand opportunities and obstacles and create a standardization plan. The standardization plan mostly needs to set expectations, including that the group may require time before advancing to standardization (e.g., while awaiting a second implementation). In short, as long as the group wants to advance to standardization and demonstrates clear intention, the staff will support that effort (and leave the group open). Depending on the situation, the staff may invest energy into encouraging the group to pursue standardization.

If the answer is "no" (or the staff believes the answer is "no" based on circumstances such as inactivity or lack of response) then the staff will support the group's migration to another venue. A community can, for example, set up its own Web site and tooling at low cost to support its ongoing activities, under its own control. Once migrated, the staff will close the group (and link to the new venue). In short, once the Community Group program no longer adds value to a community beyond Web hosting, the staff will assist the group's transition to another venue.
