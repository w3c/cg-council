# Process Enhancements for CG Specifications with Traction
Status: As of July 2025, the staff is no longer pursuing this proposal.

## Background

Once a specification has gained traction, we anticipate that implementers and users of the specification will naturally start to
prefer stability due to their investments. A group may still want to change a specification based on implementation or deployment experience, but we expect that group consensus will increasingly favor stability.

Many CGs in practice (such as WICG, Web Assembly, Social Web, and GPU for the Web, and Solid) adjust their decision-making processes once a specification gains traction. 

We are seeking generally to lower barriers to advance to standardization, but in practice there is often a delay between when a
specification has gained traction and when a W3C Working Group or other SDO has taken up the specification. 

For that reason, we propose to create guidelines for CGs that have specifications with traction.

**Note**: Although we want Specifications with traction to advance to standardization, we also want to be able to charter a Working Group in some cases where there is not traction, for example:

* The context is such that it is important to charter a standardization activity, even without one specification with traction.
* The community has not been able to converge and there are multiple competing proposals (full specifications or feature definitions) on the table. In this case, a Working Group (with its additional process supports) could help the community pursue a harmonized Specification.

## Guidelines

**Note:** This is an outline for discussion.

### Definition of Traction

> A Specification with Traction is one that fulfills any of the following criteria:
> * It is implemented in at least two products (e.g., browser engines) with large-scale distribution in the Specification ecosystem
> * Significant changes to it would disrupt the ecosystem of the Specification (e.g., in terms of adoption or references).

### Decision processes once a Specification has traction

* Chairs should seek to make decisions when there is consensus. 
* Chairs or editors determine and record consensus decisions through the GitHub repo for the specification.
* Chairs should ensure that the decision process is fair, respects the consensus of the CG, and does not unreasonably favor or discriminate against any group participant or their employer. 

### Handling formal objections

* Where participants do not reach consensus and substantial disagreement remains (e.g., the group is divided), the Editors
  should continue with their preference.
* The issue should be recorded publicly as decided without consensus. 
* Participants may choose to develop an alternative branch of the specification to seek support from implementers or
the community.
* If a specification advances to standardization, the issues decided without consensus should be brought to the attention
of the standards group.

### Appeals

Note: This may need to go in a revised CG Process.

* When a participant wishes to contest a **process matter**, they may escalate to the Community Development Lead, who will work with the participant and Chairs to understand the situation and pursue a fair resolution.
* There is no formal appeal path outside a Community Group for **technical decisions** made by the Community Group.

## Implementation Notes

* The [CG Charter template](https://w3c.github.io/cg-charter/CGCharter.html) includes relevant provisions, but these should be reviewed.
